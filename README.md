For fun, I am building this app as I go through [this](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-full-stack-development/9781484257388/) book.

It's basically an email client/server using `TypeScript`, `Node.js`, and `React`. I have only completed the server.

Some of the code is similar, some of it is different, e.g. I re-factored most of the code and I added some simple testing.

If you actually wanted to clone the repo and use it, place a `serverConfig.json` file at the project root. It should look like `server/src/serverConfig.spec.json`.
